# SAFETY DISCLAIMER

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: DO NOT USE ON REAL HARDWARE ⚠️

This software is **FOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. It has **NOT** been tested on real robotic hardware and may cause:

- **Equipment damage** to robots, sensors, and actuators
- **Personal injury** to operators and bystanders
- **Property damage** to facilities and equipment
- **Unsafe robot behavior** including unexpected movements, collisions, and system failures

## Safety Requirements for Real-World Deployment

If you intend to use this software on real hardware, you **MUST**:

1. **Expert Review**: Have robotics safety experts review all code and configurations
2. **Safety Testing**: Conduct extensive testing in controlled environments
3. **Safety Systems**: Implement proper emergency stop systems, safety barriers, and monitoring
4. **Certification**: Obtain appropriate safety certifications for your application
5. **Training**: Ensure all operators are properly trained on safety procedures
6. **Insurance**: Maintain adequate liability insurance coverage
7. **Compliance**: Meet all applicable safety standards and regulations

## Known Limitations

- **No Real Hardware Testing**: This software has only been tested in simulation
- **Unvalidated Safety Limits**: Safety parameters may not be appropriate for real robots
- **No Emergency Systems**: No built-in emergency stop or safety monitoring
- **Unverified Dynamics**: Robot dynamics models may not match real hardware
- **No Fault Tolerance**: No handling of sensor failures or communication errors

## Recommended Safety Measures

1. **Dry Run Mode**: Always test policies in simulation first
2. **Velocity Limits**: Implement conservative velocity and acceleration limits
3. **Force Limits**: Set appropriate force and torque limits
4. **Emergency Stops**: Install multiple emergency stop mechanisms
5. **Safety Barriers**: Use physical barriers around robot workspace
6. **Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring of robot state and behavior
7. **Gradual Deployment**: Start with low-speed, low-force operations
